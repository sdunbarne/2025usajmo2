  <introduction>
    <p>I use the following notation throughout this article: <m>c_i</m> denotes the digit of 
    <m>n^k</m> in the <m>(2n)^i</m> place, and <m>s_i</m> denotes the base <m>2n</m> number 
    <m>c_{i}c_{i-1}\dots c_{2}c_{1}c_{0}</p> which is the truncation of <m>n^k</m> at the 
    rightmost digits.  Note that obviously <m>n^k < (2n)^k</m>, so <m>n^k</m> has at most <m>k</m> 
    digits when expressed in base <m>2n</m>.  Then
    I find it mathematically clearer to write <m>n^k</m> in base <m>2n</m> as
    <m>n^k = c_{k-1}(2n)^{k-1} + c_{k-2}(2n)^{i-2} + \dots + c_1(2n)^1 + c_0(2n)^0</m>.  Then the goal is to
    prove that there is a positive integer <m>N</m> such that for every odd <m>n > N</m> the 
    coefficients satisfy <m>c_i\geq d+1</m> for all <m>i\geq 0</m>.</p>

    <title>First solution</title>
    <p>Let <m>x%y</m> denote the remainder when <m>x</m> is divided by <m>y</m>.  Using the 
    standard notation
    <me>
        c_i = \left\lfloor \frac{n^k}{(2n)^i} \right\rfloor % (2n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i}{2^i} \right\rfloor%(2n)
    </me>
    The first equality follows because the division by <m>(2n)^i</m> will make the series
    expansion with powers <m>j<i</m> less than <m>1</m>, so the floor function truncates them 
    off.  Then remainder by <m>2n</m> operation eliminates all but the constant term <m>c_i</m>.
    The second equality follows simple division. Now the claim is
    <me>
    \left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i}}{2^i} \right\rfloor%(2n) = 
    \left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i}%(2^{i+1}n)}{2^i} \right\rfloor,
    </me>
    that is, it is possible to move the remainder operation inside the floor function with 
    appropriate modification.
