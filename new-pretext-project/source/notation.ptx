  <title>Notation</title>
  <p>I use the following notation throughout this article: 
    <ul>
    <li> <m>c_i</m> denotes the digit of 
    <m>n^k</m> in the <m>(2n)^i</m> place, and</li> 
    <li> <m>s_i</m> denotes the base <m>2n</m> number 
    <m>c_{i}c_{i-1}\dots c_{2}c_{1}c_{0}</m> which is the truncation of <m>n^k</m> at the 
    <m>i+1</m> rightmost digits. </li> 
    </ul>
    Note that obviously <m>n^k \lt (2n)^k = 2^k n^k</m>, so <m>n^k</m> has at most <m>k</m> 
    digits in places <m>(2n)^{k-1}</m> down to the units place <m>(2n)^0</m> 
    when expressed in base <m>2n</m>. 
    I find it mathematically clearer to write <m>n^k</m> in base <m>2n</m> as
    <me>
    n^k = c_{k-1}(2n)^{k-1} + c_{k-2}(2n)^{i-2} + \dots + c_1(2n)^1 + c_0(2n)^0
    </me>.  The goal is to
    prove that there is a positive integer <m>N</m> such that for every odd <m>n > N</m> the 
    coefficients satisfy <m>c_i\geq d+1</m> for all <m>i\geq 0</m>.</p> 
<p>
For a real number <m>x</m>, write <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m> for the greatest integer less than
<m>x</m> and <m>{x} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor</me> for the fractional part of <m>x</m>.
For integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, let <m>\operatorname{rem}(x,y) </m> be the remainder
left by division of <m>x</m> by <m>y</m>.
