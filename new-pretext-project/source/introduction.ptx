    <p>The following problem appeared as Problem 2 on the 2025 USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad.</p>
    <p><em>Problem:</em> Let <m>k</m> and <m>d</m> be positive integers.  Prove that there exists a positive
     integer <m>N</m> such that for every odd integer <m>n > N</m>, the digits in the base <m>2n</m> 
     representation of <m>n^k</m> are all greater than <m>d</m>.</p>
    <p> The goal is to investigate the solution and the number theory behind that solution.
    The solutions presented here are more detailed explanations of the
    official solutions.  All additions are my own work, there are no additions from any large language model.
