    <p>The following problem appeared as Problem 2 on the 2025 USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad.</p>
    <p><em>Problem:</em> Let <m>k</m> and <m>d</m> be positive integers.  Prove that there exists a positive
     integer <m>N</m> such that for every odd integer <m>n > N</m>, the digits in the base <m>2n</m> 
     representation of <m>n^k</m> are all greater than <m>d</m>.</p>
    <p> The goal is to investigate the solution and the number theory behind that solution.</p>
